## Inheritance

Is one of the core concepts of object oriented programming (OOP).
It's a mechanism that allows to derive a class from another class and create a hyerarchy of classes that share the same attributes and methods.

Even though this mechanis can slightly differ from language to language, it is generally useful to democratize certain aspects such as declaring different kind of exceptions, add custom logic to existing frameworks, etc.

The that is derived is usually called child class or sub-class, while the original class is usually defined super-class or parent class.

Inheritance is usually accompanied by the keyword `extend`;
